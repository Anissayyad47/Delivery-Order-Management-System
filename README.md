Project : Delivery Order Management System, 

Technologies Used : react js, node js, express js, mongodb database

The motivation behind this project came from my experience working a part-time job in an organization during my first and second years. My responsibility was to manually enter each delivery record, including the delivery person's details, into the database. This was crucial because the payment of delivery personnel and other operations depended on accurate data entry. Since I was spending 4 to 6 hours a day manually entering data, I realized the need for a more efficient solution. Understanding this challenge, I decided to create a platform that would automate these tasks, ensuring faster, more accurate, and efficient data management.
